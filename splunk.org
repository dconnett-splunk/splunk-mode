;;; Commentary:

;; Run a Splunk search from Emacs.  Get the results as CSV, with option to export
;; to JSON,  HTML and Org tables.
;; The entry points are splunk-new-search and splunk-search-at-point
;; You will be prompted a query text, and time range for the query, and will get back
;; the results (when ready) in a new buffer.
;; Use describe-mode (C-h m) in the results buffer to see the available commands.
;;
;; Use the command splunk-queries-running to open a buffer with the items waiting for results
;; and splunk-queries-history to see a list of all queries completed in the session.
;;
;; For more details on usage see https://github.com/sebasmonia/splunk/blob/master/README.md
;; including some workflow suggestions.

;;; Code:
;;;
;; This buffer is for text that is not saved, and for Lisp evaluation.
;; To create a file, visit it with C-x C-f and enter text in its buffer.
